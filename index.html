    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi! I'm Lily. I'm a super duper newbie web developer. I enjoy the challenge of figuring 
        things out with little to no experience, including yoga, philosophy, and assembling Ikea furniture.
        Now that I have my 200-hour yoga teaching certification, a master's degree in Philosophy, and
        a cute Ikea nightstand, I set my sights Web Development. I currently work at an academic publisher in Philadelphia. I manage five review journals that publish research in clinical medicine and sustainable/renewable energy.  
        If I continue in publishing, I would like to work with Humanities scholarship. 
        I am hoping to apply the technical skills I learn in this course to an academic field, such as Digital Humanities.
    </p>
